# The ProcessSale Program

This program is a simple implementation of a sales process for a store. It allows the user to add items to a sale, calculate the total cost, and apply discounts. The program is designed to be easy to use and understand.

It was made for educational purposes as a part of the course IV1350 Object Oriented Programming at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.
